Collateral360 : remove the table CompanyProperty, add all the field it has to PropertyService and change the table name to CompanyPropertyService.
                  1. add default flag called IsDefault
                  2. OwnerCompanyID is null for IsDefault=1

reason: each property service is different towards each company even for the default action, non-default type service there is no point to seperate it out and have two sets of relationship. we'll just add a isDefault Flag.

Change: Added a new table "CompanyTemplate".
